# Introduction

The goal of the project is to be able to detect the removal of items from a chiller using visual techniques. The readme file will be updated as and when new code and functionality is pushed to the repository.

# System set up.

The repository has a package_requirements file that includes all the packages required to run code. The ideal set up would be to use create a virtual environment and run the following command to automatically download the required packages.

```

pip install -r package_requirements.txt

```
